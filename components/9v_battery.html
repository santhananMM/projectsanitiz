            <h2>About the 9V Battery</h2>
            <img src="../assets/9v_battery.jpg" alt="9V Battery" style="width:120px;height:auto;display:block;margin:16px 0;">
            <p>A 9V battery 🔋 is a common power source used in various electronic devices and projects, providing a compact and reliable source of power. It contains the following components:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Electrochemical Cells ⚡:</strong>
                    <br>
                    Inside the 9V battery, there are typically 6 individual 1.5V cells connected in series to produce a combined voltage of 9V. These cells are typically made of zinc-carbon or alkaline chemistry, depending on the type of 9V battery.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Positive Terminal (Anode) ➕:</strong>
                    <br>
                    The positive terminal, usually marked with a "+" sign, is connected to the top of the battery. It is connected to the internal cathodes of the individual cells.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Negative Terminal (Cathode) ➖:</strong>
                    <br>
                    The negative terminal, usually marked with a "-" sign, is connected to the bottom of the battery. It connects to the internal anodes of the individual cells.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Electrolyte 🧪:</strong>
                    <br>
                    The electrolyte is a chemical substance inside the battery that allows the movement of ions between the anode and cathode. This chemical reaction generates the electrical charge that powers devices.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Separator 🧱:</strong>
                    <br>
                    A separator material is used between the individual cells to prevent direct contact between the positive and negative terminals, ensuring safe operation and preventing short circuits.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Outer Casing (Container) 🛡️:</strong>
                    <br>
                    The outer casing of the battery is typically made of metal and plastic. It protects the internal components and helps maintain the structural integrity of the battery. It also serves as a conductive path for the electrical current.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Internal Wiring 🔌:</strong>
                    <br>
                    Inside the battery, there is internal wiring that connects the individual cells in series, ensuring that the total voltage adds up to 9V.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>How It Works ⚙️</h3>
            <p>
                When the battery is used in a device, the electrochemical reaction between the zinc (anode) and manganese dioxide (cathode) generates electrons, creating a flow of electricity.
                <br><br>
                The positive terminal ➕ sends out electrons to power the device, and the negative terminal ➖ completes the circuit by drawing electrons back from the device.
            </p>
            <h3>Common Uses 🔧</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Arduino Projects 🖥️:</strong> 9V batteries are widely used to power small electronics and microcontroller-based projects, such as an automatic hand sanitizer dispenser or simple sensors and servos.</li>
                <li><strong>Toys 🧸:</strong> Many toys and small devices, including remote-controlled models, use 9V batteries for their portable power needs.</li>
                <li><strong>Smoke Detectors 🚨:</strong> Some smoke detectors are powered by 9V batteries to ensure a long-lasting and reliable power source.</li>
            </ul>
