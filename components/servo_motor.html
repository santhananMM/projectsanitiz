            <img src="../assets/servomotor.jpg" alt="Servo Motor MG996" style="width:140px;height:auto;display:block;margin:16px 0;">
            <h3>Key Features:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>High Torque 💪:</strong><br>
                    The MG996 servo motor is capable of delivering a high torque output, typically around 9-11 kg·cm at 4.8V and up to 12 kg·cm at 6V. This makes it powerful enough to handle heavier loads compared to standard servos, which is why it's commonly used in robotics and large mechanical systems.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Speed 🕓:</strong><br>
                    The MG996 has a speed of approximately 0.2 seconds per 60° at 4.8V and 0.18 seconds per 60° at 6V. This speed is fast enough for most applications requiring controlled movement but isn't as fast as high-speed servos.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Operating Voltage ⚡:</strong><br>
                    The MG996 servo typically operates between 4.8V and 6.0V, allowing it to be powered by a range of standard voltage sources like a typical 5V microcontroller or battery pack.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Durable Gear Mechanism ⚙️:</strong><br>
                    The MG996 is equipped with metal gears, providing it with added durability and the ability to withstand higher mechanical stress compared to plastic-geared servos. This feature makes it suitable for demanding tasks like lifting or moving heavy objects.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Control and Precision 🎯:</strong><br>
                    Like other servos, the MG996 is controlled using Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) signals, which determine the position of the motor shaft. It offers precise control, making it ideal for applications requiring detailed position adjustments.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Rotation Range 🔄:</strong><br>
                    The MG996 can rotate within a typical range of 0° to 180°, but depending on the servo and configuration, it may offer more flexibility, including some continuous rotation features in certain cases.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>How It Works ⚙️:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>PWM Control:</strong><br>
                    The MG996 servo motor uses Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) to control its movement. The position of the motor shaft is determined by the width of the PWM signal:<br>
                    &bull; A pulse width of about 1.5 ms usually moves the servo to its neutral position (typically 90°).<br>
                    &bull; Shorter pulses (e.g., 1 ms) move the servo closer to 0°.<br>
                    &bull; Longer pulses (e.g., 2 ms) move the servo closer to 180°.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Internal Feedback Mechanism:</strong><br>
                    The servo includes an internal potentiometer that provides feedback on the motor's position, allowing it to adjust its movement and maintain the desired position. This feedback mechanism ensures precise and accurate control of the servo's shaft.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Motor Shaft Rotation:</strong><br>
                    The servo motor’s shaft is driven by an internal motor that rotates based on the PWM signal. This shaft is connected to metal gears, which help transfer the rotational force with higher torque and precision compared to cheaper servos with plastic gears.
                </li>
            </ul>
