            <p>
                A rocker switch is a type of electrical switch that rocks back and forth to open or close a circuit. It is commonly used in various household and electronic devices to control power. When pressed on one side, the switch activates or deactivates the circuit.
            </p>
            <h3>Key Features:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Rocking Mechanism 🔄:</strong><br>
                    A rocker switch has a tilting mechanism that "rocks" when pressed. The switch typically has a two-position toggle (ON and OFF) where it stays in either position once pressed, providing tactile feedback.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Simple ON/OFF Control ⏺️:</strong><br>
                    Most rocker switches have a simple ON/OFF function, making them ideal for controlling the power flow in devices, circuits, or machines.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Variety of Styles and Sizes 📏:</strong><br>
                    Rocker switches come in different sizes, shapes, and mounting options. Some are designed for panel mounting, while others may be surface-mounted for easy integration into custom projects.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Multiple Functions ⚙️:</strong><br>
                    While many rocker switches are used for basic power control (ON/OFF), some may include additional features such as LED indicators, multiple positions (e.g., 3-way switches), or other special configurations (like momentary switches).
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Durability 💪:</strong><br>
                    Rocker switches are often built to handle many cycles of use, making them a durable option for electronic products and machinery.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>How It Works ⚙️:</h3>
            <p>
                Pressing the switch on one side of the rocker tilts it, and this action either opens or closes the circuit.<br><br>
                When ON, the circuit is closed, and electricity can flow to power a device or system.<br>
                When OFF, the circuit is open, cutting off the power.<br><br>
                Rocker switches can be integrated into electronic projects to control devices like motors, lights, or other electronic components. The switch makes it simple to toggle power without complex wiring.
