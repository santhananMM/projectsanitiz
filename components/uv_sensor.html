            <p>
                The HC-SR04 is a widely used ultrasonic sensor that measures distances by using ultrasonic sound waves. It’s a popular sensor in robotics, automation, and DIY electronics due to its accuracy, simplicity, and low cost. It measures distance by emitting a sound wave and measuring the time it takes for the echo to return.

            <h3>Key Features:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Distance Measurement 📏:</strong><br>
                    The HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor can measure distances ranging from 2 cm to 400 cm with a high degree of accuracy. This makes it perfect for applications like distance sensing, obstacle detection, and proximity sensing.

                <li>
                    <strong>Two Components 🔄:</strong><br>
                    The sensor consists of two main components:<br>
                    <strong>Transmitter:</strong> Emits the ultrasonic pulse.<br>
                    <strong>Receiver:</strong> Receives the reflected pulse (echo).
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Working Principle ⚙️:</strong><br>
                    The sensor emits an ultrasonic sound wave at a frequency of 40 kHz. When the sound wave hits an object, it bounces back toward the sensor, and the echo time is measured. The distance is then calculated based on the time it took for the echo to return.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Simple Interface 🔌:</strong><br>
                    The HC-SR04 sensor is easy to interface with a microcontroller (like Arduino) using just four pins:<br>
                    VCC: Power input (usually 5V).<br>
                    Trig: Trigger pin to initiate the measurement.<br>
                    Echo: Receives the pulse’s return time.<br>
                    GND: Ground pin.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Low Power Consumption ⚡:</strong><br>
                    The HC-SR04 sensor is energy-efficient, making it ideal for battery-powered projects like robots, drones, or automatic measurement systems.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>How It Works ⚙️:</h3>
            <p>
                <strong>Triggering:</strong> To begin a distance measurement, you send a 10-microsecond pulse to the Trig pin. This triggers the sensor to emit an ultrasonic pulse.<br><br>
                <strong>Echo Reception:</strong> The sensor emits the ultrasonic sound wave, which travels through the air. When the wave encounters an object, it bounces back, and the Echo pin receives the signal.<br><br>
                <strong>Time Calculation:</strong> The time taken for the pulse to travel from the sensor to the object and back is recorded. Since the speed of sound is known (approximately 343 meters per second in air at room temperature), the distance can be calculated using the formula:<br>
                <code>Distance = (Time × Speed of Sound) / 2</code><br>
                The division by 2 accounts for the fact that the sound travels to the object and back.
            </p>
